            <h2 data-i18n="about.whyBuilt.title">Why I Built This</h2>
            <p data-i18n="about.whyBuilt.p1">I recently visited my parents. Everything was fine until one morning my mom started blaming me for "doing something" to their phone. <a href="https://www.phonepe.com/" target="_blank">PhonePe</a> had updated its design overnight, and both of them were confused. I spent an hour patiently teaching them the new interface step by step. That trip, I also ended up showing them how to make a video call on WhatsApp.</p>
            
            <p data-i18n="about.whyBuilt.p2">After I returned to Bangalore, it hit me: I won't always be around to sit next to them and help. And honestly, explaining things over a phone call never really works. It wasn't just them. I've seen this happen with my friends' parents too. We teach them, but since they don't get to practice, they forget and then feel frustrated or even embarrassed to ask again.</p>
            
            <p data-i18n="about.whyBuilt.p3">That's when I decided to build this tool.</p>
            
            <p data-i18n="about.whyBuilt.p4">It's simple. It lets my parents (or anyone, really), practice using apps like PhonePe, WhatsApp through step-by-step tutorials on their own. It can be practiced as many times as needed, without anyone rushing or judging them. Whether it's a complex flow or a basic feature, they can revisit it anytime. It's even helpful for me. I can teach them features they've never used before, like downloading bank statements, sending a voice note or adjust WhatsApp settings, from miles away.</p>
            
            <p data-i18n="about.whyBuilt.p5">I built this so my parents can feel a little more confident, a little more independent, and a little less scared of technology. Because sometimes, all they need is a safe space to practice.</p>
            
            <h2 data-i18n="about.whoAmI.title">Who Am I?</h2>
